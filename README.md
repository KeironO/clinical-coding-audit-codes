# Free and Open Source Audit Codes for Clinical Coding

A bunch of free and open source audit codes for use in auditing both manual and automated clinical coding. Sister project to CLIVSECO.


## Terminology

### Documentation Issues

- PD - Primary Diagnosis
- SD - Secondary Diagnosis
- PP - Primary Procedure
- SP - Secondary Procedure

So **_NAV** will become  **PDNAV**...

- **_NAV:** Documentation required for accurate coding was not available at the time of coding.
- **_INC:** Inconsistent with the available documentation.
- **_ILL:** The documentation used to code the episode was illegible, resulting in missing codes.
- **_LEX:** The code is present within the documentation, but written in a manner in which makes it impossible to code.

### Coding Errors


### Misc

- **CLIFA:** Issue with the auto coder at the time of automated coding.
- **DWARE:** Issues with the data warehouse at the time of automated coding.
- **CONSU:**: Consultant has requested specific coding.
- **SNOMM:** Terminology missing from SNOMED-CT.
